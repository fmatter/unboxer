# Getting started

The unboxer is a tool to turn [toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) and [shoebox](https://software.sil.org/shoebox/) databases into CSV files.
Its primary focus is the creation of [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/) datasets, but the extracted files can be used in other ways, too.

## Installation

Install the unboxer python library:

```shell
pip install unboxer
```

## Problems
1. if running `unbox` produces warnings, check your database for possible inconsistencies
2. if that did not solve your problem, [open an issue](https://github.com/fmatter/unboxer/issues/new)
